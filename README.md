# Method Overloading Calculator

This is a simple **Java-based Calculator Application** that demonstrates the concept of **method overloading**.  
The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with support for different data types (integers and doubles) and varying numbers of parameters.

## Features

- **Addition (Method Overloading)**:  
  Supports multiple ways to add numbers:
  - Add two integers  
  - Add two doubles  
  - Add three integers  

- **Subtraction**:  
  Subtracts two integers and displays the result.

- **Multiplication**:  
  Multiplies two double values.

- **Division**:  
  Divides two integers with proper handling for **division by zero**.

- **Menu-Driven Interface**:  
  Provides an interactive menu for users to choose operations and input numbers dynamically.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Includes exception handling for invalid operations like division by zero.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, or VS Code) to run the application.

## Running the Application

### 1. Compile the Java Code

Make sure you have the JDK installed on your system.  
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `Interface.java` file.

Use the following command to compile the program:

```bash
javac Interface.java
